        <h1>The Filter Bubble Machine</h1>
        <p>This application was made to gain insight in the origin and spread of filter bubbles. 
          It is used to simulate the spread of disinformation through social media algorithms.

        <h2>What you will find</h2>
        <p>The Bubble Machine shows a simulation of users and their relation to documents and each other. Click the user and the document to see more.</p>

          <p class="user-info">This pentagon shows a user in the simulation, every step they can change their position and relations to documents
            and friends.</p>

              The user can choose to encorporate this article, this has effects on their position in the filter bubble.

            <h3>Origin of filter bubbles</h3>
            <p>By running the simulation you will start to see users cluster together and form their own 
              filter bubble. Which means they recieve less and less information that will challenge their beliefs.
