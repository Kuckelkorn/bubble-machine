# Bubblemachine
The Bubble Machine is an online simulator tool that allows journalists, researchers and activists to mimic the spread of disinformation through the interaction between users, media networks and news outlets curated by recommendation systems. 

The Bubble Machine aims to provide journalists, researchers and people interested in the subject with direct insight into the mechanisms behind disinformation. More specifically, investigate the interplay between personal preferences, social and technological interactions.

## Beschrijving
Social media algorithms play a major role in distributing and amplifying disinformation. Recommendation algorithms, in particular, speed up and amplify the spread of (dis)information through the emergence of *filter bubbles*. Use of these algorithms can lead to filter bubbles: online environments where only one's own opinion is heard and seen. Users who spread extreme messages can use algorithms to make a strong contribution to the creation of filter bubbles (Boutyline & Willer, 2017).

Social media companies are secretive about the inner workings of their products. No one knows exactly how the algorithms work. Researchers at Responsible IT have studied recommendation algorithms and developed a working model and software tools to mimic how they work. This project makes these models available and usable for the public.

The Responsible IT research group at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam conducts academic and applied research on technologies behind fake news detection, filter bubbles and recommendation algorithms. 

Through our collaborations with partners in the Dutch media and design industry and the City of Amsterdam, we recognize the urgent need for an easy-to-use tool like The Bubble Machine to **understand the mechanisms of misinformation**.

## Design challenge

The Responsible IT computer model is currently not accessible to the public. 

The resulting outcome of this project is a public web application which is a pleasure to use. 

With the  web application you develop, journalists and the public can simulate the spread of news and evaluate how the interplay between cognitive filters, social network interaction and recommender systems affects the diversity of content exposed to users. 

Through an interactive, instructive an intuitive web interface, the app will offer specialists a simulator environment with various parameters such as users' characteristics, social network settings, and specific types of recommender systems. By running the simulator with different parameters, users can visualise, compare and analyse the consequence of combining various factors.

### User stories
1 As a journalist, I can use a web-based simulator environment so I can visualize the spread of news through a network. 
2 As a journalist, I can change various parameters of the simulator to combine factors that affects the diversity of content exposed to users.  
3 As a journalist, I can run a simulation so I can evaluate the interplay between cognitive filters, social network interaction and recommender systems in  visualisations. 

## Data
Relevante data is via een API te ontsluiten.

## Planning
In de eerste week van de meesterproef is een briefing met de opdrachtgever en begeleiders. Wekelijks wordt aan de opdrachtgever een prototype gedemonstreerd en de volgende stappen besproken. Tussentijds kunnen via Teams vragen gesteld worden.
